# GAIN-tensorflow [under construction]

**Note: the code is not stable and some functions are still under construction**

The repository holds the implementation of [GAIN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.10171.pdf).
 * baseline network for Weakly-Supervised Segmentation Task mainly borrows code from [xtudbxk/SEC-tensorflow](https://github.com/xtudbxk/SEC-tensorflow).
 * preparation setup: please follow steps in [xtudbxk/SEC-tensorflow](https://github.com/xtudbxk/SEC-tensorflow) to install the required package and download the data/pre-trained model.
 * train the network: `python GAIN-SEC.py -g <gpu_id>`
